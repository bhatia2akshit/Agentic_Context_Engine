# Rulebook-Agent 🧠📚

**Rulebook-Agent** is a stateful, agentic AI service designed to reason over complex documents such as regulations, policies, and rulebooks.

Unlike stateless RAG chatbots, the system maintains persistent session memory, blends long-term document knowledge with short-term user context, and exposes this reasoning through a secure, authenticated API. The agent actively updates, forgets, and reuses context across interactions, enabling consistent and grounded decision-making rather than isolated answers.

Built with FastAPI, LangChain, FAISS, and Mistral, Rulebook-Agent is intended for real-world domains where rules matter, memory matters, and AI systems must behave more like agents than conversational toys.
